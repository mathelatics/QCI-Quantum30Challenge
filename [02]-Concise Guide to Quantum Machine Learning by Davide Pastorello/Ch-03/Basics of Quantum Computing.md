**What is Quantum Computing ?**

> It is a Computation which exploits the Quantum phenomena like Super-position, Entanglement, Inferences, Tunneling e.t.c to perform the calculations. Quantum Computing provides the different algorithms for solving computationaly hard problem which are not possible to be solve on classical computers.

> We will learn about the universal quantum models like Quantum Circuit Models, Adiabatic Quantum Models and Quantum Annealer Models.

**How can we encode our data into quantum states ?**

> In Quantum Information, it is called quantum encoding , procedural way of mapping the classical data into the physical states of quantum systems. We encode either discrete variable or the continuous variable into quantum states.
